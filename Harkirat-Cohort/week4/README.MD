# FileServer File of that folder Expose to HTTP server (fileServer.js)

- You need to create an express HTTP server in Node.js which will handle the logic of a file server.Use built in Node.js `fs` module

- GET /files - Returns a list of files present in `./files/` directory. Response: 200 OK with an array of file names in JSON format.Example: GET http://localhost:3000/files

- GET /file/:filename - Returns content of given file by name
  Description: Use the filename from the request path parameter to read the file from `./files/` directory
  Response: 200 OK with the file content as the response body if found, or 404 Not Found if not found. Should return `File not found` as text if file is not found
  Example: GET http://localhost:3000/file/example.txt

- or any other route not defined in the server return 404
  Testing the server - run `npm run test-fileServer` command in terminal

# Todo App

You need to create an express HTTP server in Node.js which will handle the logic of a todo list app.

- Don't use any database, just store all the data in an array to store the todo list data (in-memory)
- Hard todo: Try to save responses in files, so that even if u exit the app and run it again, the data remains (similar to databases)
  Each todo has a title and a description. The title is a string and the description is a string.
  Each todo should also get an unique autogenerated id every time it is created
  The expected API endpoints are defined below,
- 1.GET /todos - Retrieve all todo items
  Description: Returns a list of all todo items.
  Response: 200 OK with an array of todo items in JSON format.
  Example: GET http://localhost:3000/todos
- 2.GET /todos/:id - Retrieve a specific todo item by ID
  Description: Returns a specific todo item identified by its ID.
  Response: 200 OK with the todo item in JSON format if found, or 404 Not Found if not found.
  Example: GET http://localhost:3000/todos/123
- 3.POST /todos - Create a new todo item
  Description: Creates a new todo item.
  Request Body: JSON object representing the todo item.
  Response: 201 Created with the ID of the created todo item in JSON format. eg: {id: 1}
  Example: POST http://localhost:3000/todos
  Request Body: { "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": false, description: "I should buy groceries" }
- 4.PUT /todos/:id - Update an existing todo item by ID
  Description: Updates an existing todo item identified by its ID.
  Request Body: JSON object representing the updated todo item.
  Response: 200 OK if the todo item was found and updated, or 404 Not Found if not found.
  Example: PUT http://localhost:3000/todos/123
  Request Body: { "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": true }
- 5.DELETE /todos/:id - Delete a todo item by ID
  Description: Deletes a todo item identified by its ID.
  Response: 200 OK if the todo item was found and deleted, or 404 Not Found if not found.
  Example: DELETE http://localhost:3000/todos/123
  - For any other route not defined in the server return 404
    Testing the server - run `npm run test-todoServer` command in terminal
